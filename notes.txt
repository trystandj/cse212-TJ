A stack is a data structure that is characterized by the order in which items are added or removed. often called last in, first out, or lifo
Each time you add something its called a push operation
when we take a object off its called pop operationwe push and pop from the back of the stack 
removing from the middle of the stack is not generally allowed. 
The real beneifit of the stack is the ability to remember where we have beneifit

One common example is the control z or undo
when you type you push to the stack, then cntrol z pops the last one from the back

Stacks are useful when we need to maintain history and perform an operation 
for example undo function in an editor backwards

Grocery Story Queue
In the example below, we can see a line at a busy grocery store used 
to represent a queue. The person next in line for the cashier is called
the front and the person at the end of the line is called the back. When 
the person at the front is removed from the queue we call this a dequeue operation. When a new person joins the queue 
at the back, we call this an enqueue operation. Note that someone cannot cheat and enter the line in the middle of the queue.

Some variables are called multiple times or at the same time. One solution to protect the code that is writing to the shared dataso that only one 
process can change the variable at a time. A queue is used to ensure order and integrity. 
when a process wants to write, it is enqueued. 
when a process is dequeued it is then allowed to modify the shared variable when the process is done
the next process is dequeued.

Be mindful of how the data is being entered to the stack when debugging or udnerstanding the code
The data could be flowing normally or in reverse
